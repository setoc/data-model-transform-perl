# data-model-transform-perl
Multi-user Data modeling and transformation based on perl and sql database. 

Describe a data model schema with XML and how to transform that data to other databases.  The XML schema file is used to generate a SQL database and helps the code perform inserts, updates, and deletes on data in the SQL database.  When a data model is complete, create a snapshot of it for historical use, and export the data to other databases.

Multiple users can work in parallel, creating changes to the data model, and all changes can be merged into a single data model.
