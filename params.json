The XML schema file is used to generate a SQL database and helps the code perform inserts, updates, and deletes on data in the SQL database.  When a data model is complete, create a snapshot of it for historical use, and export the data to other databases.\r\n\r\nMultiple users can work in parallel, creating changes to the data model, and all changes can be merged into a single data model.\r\n\r\n## perl dependencies\r\n(these have dependencies of their own)\r\n- DBIx-Lite\r\n- Data-UUID\r\n- Log-Dispatch\r\n- Log-Log4perl\r\n",
